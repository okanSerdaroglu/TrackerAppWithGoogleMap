There are 2 ways of using GoogleMaps in your app.
The first one is using MapView, the second one is MapFragment.
Google map has it's own lifecycle. If you use a mapView in a fragment you have to worry about
your Google map lifecycle. However if you use a mapFragment you should not worry about
lifecycle of map.

** Foreground service must come with a notification.
Android system can not kill this service in low memory case.

--- Making our service a Foreground Service

   1- Firstly create a service class which extends from LifecycleService() class.

   2- Override onStartCommandFunction and handle your intent action

   3- If ACTION_START_OR_RESUME_SERVICE and isFirstRun then call startForegroundService() method

   4- In startForegroundService() method create a notificationManager and a notificationBuilder.
      If your version greater than Oreo create a notification channel and start your foreground service
      with your NOTIFICATION_ID and your builder.

   5 - When you click your notification, MainActivity have to open. For this reason we must create
       a pending intent. You have to add an action for Intent because we have to detect that we should
       open TrackingFragment in this case.

   6 - This intent should be handled in MainActivity to open trackingFragment in onCreate and
       onNewIntent methods
