There are 2 ways of using GoogleMaps in your app.
The first one is using MapView, the second one is MapFragment.
Google map has it's own lifecycle. If you use a mapView in a fragment you have to worry about
your Google map lifecycle. However if you use a mapFragment you should not worry about
lifecycle of map.
